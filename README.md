This repository contains Rust bindings for AMD ROCm HIP runtime libraries (hiprtc, amdhip64) used by CubeCL.

## ⚠️ Notes
These bindings are unsafe as they are just the raw bindings generated by bindgen with no improvements.

## Limitations

- Works only on Linux
- Bindings generated for AMD GPUs only

## Prerequisites

Install ROCm following the [ROCm documentation][1]:

## Versioning Scheme

The crates in this repository follow the same versioning as HIP. Note that HIP version is somewhat different than ROCm version.
The patch number of HIP version is a monotonic number that uniquely indentify the version of HIP.

This versioning scheme is in place as of May 2025, any previous version of this crate followed a different versioning scheme based
on ROCm version instead of HIP.

Note also that multiple versions of ROCm can ship the same version of HIP.

### Example:

The `cubecl-hip-sys` version `6.4.43482` represents the HIP with the same version `6.4.43482`.

## Usage

Add the crate [cubecl-hip-sys][2] to the `Cargo.toml` file of your project. If no feature is set then cargo will select the HIP
version returned by the `hipconfig` utility.

To specify a different version of HIP manually set the environment variable HIP_PATH to a valid HIP installation path. You can
verify that your system points to the expected version with the command `hipconfig --version`.

Remark: Don't set manually the `hip_xxx` feature for this crate. This is the responsibility of the `build.rs` script to set it
accordingly to your `hipconfig` output.

Here is the table of currently available bindings:

| HIP Version | Corresponding ROCm Version Range |
|:------------|:---------------------------------|
| 41134       | 6.2.2~6.2.4                      |
| 42131       | 6.3.0                            |
| 42133       | 6.3.1                            |
| 42134       | 6.3.2~6.3.4                      |
| 43482       | 6.4.0                            |

## Running tests

To run tests you need to first meet the expectations for both `Prerequisites` and `Usage`
sections.

Then execute the following xtask command by providing the version of ROCm to test, for instance `-v 6.2.2`:

```sh
# test ROCm bindings againt the system default ROCm installation if found
cargo xtask test
# test a specific version that is not the default
cargo xtask test -v 6.2.2
```

Important: always make sure that ROCm environment variable (see Usage) points to a version that matches the
tested version.

## Generate bindings for a given version of ROCm

1) To generate the bindings you need to first meet the expectations for both `Prerequisites`
and `Usage` sections.

2) Generate the bindings using the dedicated xtask command `bindgen`. For instance, to generate
the bindings for the crate `cubecl-hip-sys` and the ROCm version `6.3.0`:

```sh
cargo xtask bindgen -c cubecl-hip-sys -v 6.3.0
```

3) If the HIP bindings patch version has changed, declare a new `hip` feature in the `Cargo.toml`
of the corresponding crate `cubecl-hip-sys` with the format `hip_<patch_version>`. For instance
the version `6.3.0` has a new HIP patch version which is `42131`. Is the patch version did not
change then skip this step.

```toml
[features]
hip_42131 = []
```

4) Declare a new `rocm` feature in the `Cargo.toml` of the corresponding crate `cubecl-hip-sys`
with the format `rocm__<version>` where `<version>` is the ROCm version with `_` separator and
add a dependency on its corresponding HIP bindings patch version. Note that sometimes the HIP
bindings are not changed between two version of ROCm, in this case reuse the already existing
hip feature.

```toml
[features]
rocm__6_3_0 = [ "hip_42131" ]
```

4) Add the generated bindings module to the file `crates/cubecl-hip-sys/src/bindings/mod.rs`
conditionally to the new feature you just declared as well as the re-exports:

```rs
#[cfg(feature = "hip_42131")]
mod bindings_42131;
#[cfg(feature = "hip_42131")]
pub use bindings_42131::*;
```

5) Run the tests as explain in the previous section using the new feature you just created.

6) Open a pull request with the modifications, do not forget to add the new generated bindings
file in the `crates/cubecl-hip-sys/src/bindings/` directory.

7) Note that the CI runner might need to be updated by an administrator to install the new version of ROCm.
