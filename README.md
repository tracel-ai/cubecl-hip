This repository contains Rust bindings for AMD ROCm HIP runtime libraries (hiprtc, amdhip64) used by CubeCL.

## ⚠️ Notes
These bindings are unsafe as they are just the raw bindings generated by bindgen with no improvements.

## Limitations

- Works only on Linux
- Bindings generated for AMD GPUs only

## Prerequisites

Install ROCm following the [ROCm documentation][1]:

## Versioning Scheme

The crates in this repository follow the same versioning as HIP. Note that HIP version is somewhat different than ROCm version.
The patch number of HIP version is a monotonic number that uniquely identify the version of HIP.

We had a pre-release number (that acts as official release number), for instance `6.4.43482-1` represents the first release of the
bindings for HIP `43482` of ROCm `6.4.x` and `6.4.43482-2` represents the second release for these same bindings.

This versioning scheme is in place as of October 2025, any previous version of this crate followed a different versioning scheme based
on ROCm version instead of HIP.

Note also that multiple versions of ROCm can ship the same version of HIP.

## Usage

Add the crate [cubecl-hip-sys][2] to the `Cargo.toml` file of your project. Cargo will select the HIP version returned by
the `hipconfig` utility.

To specify a different version of HIP manually set the environment variable HIP_PATH to a valid HIP installation path. You can
verify that your system points to the expected version with the command `hipconfig --version`.

Remark: Don't set manually the `hip_xxx` feature for this crate. This is the responsibility of the `build.rs` script to set it
accordingly to your `hipconfig` output.

Here is the table of currently available bindings:

| HIP Version | ROCm Version Range |
|:------------|:-------------------|
| 41134       | 6.2.2~6.2.4        |
| 42131       | 6.3.0              |
| 42133       | 6.3.1              |
| 42134       | 6.3.2~6.3.4        |
| 43482       | 6.4.0              |
| 43483       | 6.4.1              |

## Running tests

To run tests you need to first meet the expectations for `Prerequisites` section.

Then execute the following xtask command:

```sh
# test ROCm bindings againt the system default ROCm installation if found
cargo xtask test
# test a specific version that is not the default by providing a value for HIP_PATH using -p
xtask test -p /opt/rocm-6.3.0
```

## Generate bindings for a given version of ROCm

1) To generate the bindings you first need to meet the expectations for `Prerequisites` section.

2) Make sure that `hipconfig` returns the path of the HIP version you want to wrap. Adapt the `HIP_PATH`
environment variable to point to the version you are interested in.

3) Generate the bindings using the dedicated xtask command `bindgen`:

```sh
cargo xtask bindgen
```

4) Declare a new `hip` feature in the `Cargo.toml` in `cubecl-hip-sys` crate with the format
`hip_<patch_version>`. You can retrieve the patch version with the command `hipconfig --version`.
For instance for a new HIP patch version which is `42131` add the following feature:

```toml
[features]
hip_42131 = []
```

5) Add the generated bindings module to the file `crates/cubecl-hip-sys/src/bindings/mod.rs`
conditionally to the new feature you just declared as well as the re-exports:

```rs
#[cfg(feature = "hip_42131")]
mod bindings_42131;
#[cfg(feature = "hip_42131")]
pub use bindings_42131::*;
```

5) Run the tests as explain in the previous section.

6) Open a pull request with the modifications, do not forget to add the new generated bindings
file in the `crates/cubecl-hip-sys/src/bindings/` directory.

7) Note that the CI runner might need to be updated by an administrator so that the new HIP version is available
on the runner.
